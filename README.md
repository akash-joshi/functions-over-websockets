# RocketRPC ðŸš€ - A fast and secure RPC to expose server data to a client.

![Frame 8175 (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22196279/219864833-74471e79-8afe-446a-95f6-7d37ef007e97.png)

RocketRPC is typesafe RPC library which gets out of your way. Define methods in your server, which you can access instantly in your client - complete with auto-completions and type-checking.

### Installation

Install the package

```sh
npm i rocketrpc
```

### Client

> Note: On the client side, all functions return a Promise with the result by default, because of the asynchronous nature of sockets. So, all passed functions are also modified to return a Promise.

```ts
import { Client } from "rocketrpc";
import { API } from "../server";

const client = Client<API>("http://localhost:8080");

const { listFiles, prisma } = client;

const main = async () => {
  // use prisma on the client
  console.log(await prisma.user.findMany());

  // passing multiple parameters to the function
  console.log(await client.sum(12, 20));

  // get server details
  console.log(await listFiles());
};

main();
```

### Server

```ts
import { Server } from "rocketrpc";
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

import listFiles from "./apis/listFiles";

const api = {
  // initialize Prisma once
  prisma: new PrismaClient();

  sum: (x: number, y: number) => x + y,

  // Fetch all files on server
  listFiles,
};

export type API = typeof api;

Server(8080, api);
```

## Error Handling

At the moment, any error on the server-side is sent to `std:error` and thrown on the client side.

Try running the examples locally!

## Metadata Context

### Socket Client

The socket.io client being used by rocketRPC is accessible via the `_rocketRpcContext` key.

## How does it work internally?

In short, the library depends on Websockets, Object Proxies, and Typescript generics to work. In detail:

### 1. Websockets

We use socket.io for fast and reliable socket connections. Websockets can be lighter than HTTP requests when a large number of connections are needed. Also, they have a smaller code footprint than HTTP requests. Their usage is anyways abstracted away in the codebase, and they can be replaced with any other technology if needed.

### 2. Object Proxies

The framework utilizes Object Proxies get control over the client object. Any function call made on a property of the client object (or on a deconstructed property), like

```ts
client.functionOne();

// or

const { functionOne } = client;
functionOne();
```

is handled by a `get` property which has been set on the Object Proxy [here](https://github.com/akash-joshi/functions-without-borders/blob/45ed7558845b6dbf03fc368b96ca175262956051/src/client/index.ts#L33).

You can go through the code to see how it uses the property name and parameters to make a socket call to the server.

### 3. Typescript Generics

All of the auto-complete goodness that the framework provides throughout the app depends on Typescript generics. On the server side, the type is directly applied on the API object,

```ts
const api: API = { ...yourApi };
```

while on the client side it's passed to the `Client` initializer.

```ts
const client = Client<API>(endpoint);
```

The client function is actually a generic, which accepts the type provided by the user and applies `Promise` to the return type of each of them. It's a very Typescript-specific piece of code but you can read it [here](https://github.com/akash-joshi/functions-without-borders/blob/01553873cd1a1f1acc66270c5521a74b58680be0/src/client/index.ts#L3).
